# Open Collective Data Visualization
  Open Collective is a fundraising platform that creaetes transparently funded communities.
By making all transactions public, both donations and expenses, Open Collective supports grassroots communities that rely
on donations to raise, manage, and spend their money. The benefit that Open Collective provides to the patron is the
ability to track and assess how their donations are being spent. While Open Collective successfully provides a more open transparent space
through their download CSV function, they fall short of providing potential patrons with the resources to properly interpret that data, That is where Open Collective Data Visualization (OCDV) helps.
By providing tables, graphs, and other important information OCDV allows all potential patrons to properly assess how well the money is being managed and ultimantly decide if they want to support the community.
